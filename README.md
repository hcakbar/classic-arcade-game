# Classic Arcade Game

## Why This Game Project?
Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.

### Basic Functionality

In this game have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won

### How to Play?
* Play here: [Classic Arcade Game - Buggy](https://hcakbar.github.io/classic-arcade-game/)
* Once you have downloaded/cloned this project, run the index.html and game should run.
* Use keyboard arrow key (left, right, up, and down) to move the player.
* Avoid enemy (bugs) and reach to water will increase level and speed.
* Collide with an enemy (bugs) will reduce lives.
* If lose all lives, game over.

# Classic Arcade Game

## Why This Game Project?
Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.

### Basic Functionality

In this game have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
